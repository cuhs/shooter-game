## üèóÔ∏è Code Architecture

The game is built with a modular architecture centered around the main `Game` class. The codebase is organized into logical sections for easy maintenance and extension.

### Main Components

#### 1. Game Configuration (`GameConfig`)
Central configuration object containing all game constants:
- Player stats and abilities
- Weapon configurations
- Enemy types and behaviors
- Wave progression settings
- Visual and audio settings

#### 2. Entity Classes
- **Player**: Handles movement, health, shields, and abilities
- **Enemy**: AI behaviors, combat stats, and visual effects
- **Projectile**: Physics, collision, and special effects

#### 3. Game Systems
- **Camera System**: Smooth following and coordinate conversion
- **Weapon System**: Firing mechanics and projectile management
- **Enemy Manager**: Spawning, AI coordination, and wave management
- **Ability System**: Class-specific special abilities and cooldowns
- **Space Generator**: Background elements and environmental objects

#### 4. Core Game Loop
```javascript
gameLoop() {
    this.update();    // Game logic and physics
    this.render();    // Drawing and visual effects
    requestAnimationFrame(() => this.gameLoop());
}
```

### Key Systems

#### Update Cycle
1. **Input Processing**: Handle player controls and UI interactions
2. **Physics Update**: Move entities and update timers
3. **Collision Detection**: Check projectile/enemy and player/enemy collisions
4. **AI Processing**: Update enemy behaviors and pathfinding
5. **Wave Management**: Spawn enemies and progress waves
6. **Effect Updates**: Particles, abilities, and visual effects

#### Rendering Pipeline
1. **Background**: Stars, planets, and space objects
2. **Environmental**: Hazards and battlefield elements
3. **Entities**: Enemies, player, and projectiles
4. **Effects**: Particles, explosions, and visual feedback
5. **UI Elements**: Health bars, minimap, and menus

## üéØ Game Balance

### Difficulty Scaling
- **Wave Progression**: Enemy count and variety increase each wave
- **Enemy Stats**: Health and damage scale with wave number
- **Special Enemies**: New enemy types unlock in later waves

### Class Balance
Each class has distinct strengths and weaknesses:
- **Tank**: Survivability vs. mobility trade-off
- **Hunter**: Balanced with versatile upgrade paths
- **Berserker**: High risk/high reward gameplay
- **Assassin**: Skill-based with mobility focus
- **Engineer**: Strategic placement and resource management

## üîß Configuration

### Gameplay Tweaking
Modify `GameConfig` object in `game-bundle.js`:
```javascript
const GameConfig = {
    PLAYER: {
        MAX_HEALTH: 100,    // Base player health
        SPEED: 5,           // Movement speed
        DASH_COOLDOWN: 60   // Dash cooldown in frames
    },
    WEAPONS: [
        // Weapon configurations
    ],
    ENEMY_TYPES: {
        // Enemy definitions
    }
};
```

### Visual Customization
- **Colors**: Modify entity colors in GameConfig
- **Effects**: Adjust particle counts and lifetimes
- **UI**: Update styles.css for HUD appearance

## üêõ Development

### Adding New Features

#### New Enemy Type
1. Add configuration to `GameConfig.ENEMY_TYPES`
2. Implement behavior in `Enemy.update()` method
3. Add visual representation in rendering system

#### New Weapon
1. Add weapon config to `GameConfig.WEAPONS`
2. Implement special effects in projectile system
3. Update UI to display weapon stats

#### New Class Ability
1. Add to class configuration in Game constructor
2. Implement effect in upgrade system
3. Add visual feedback and UI elements

### Performance Considerations
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse projectile and particle objects
- **Culling**: Only render objects within camera view
- **Efficient Collision**: Use spatial partitioning for large enemy counts

## üìä Technical Specifications

- **Target FPS**: 60 FPS
- **Canvas Resolution**: Dynamic (window size)
- **World Size**: 4000x3000 pixels
- **Max Entities**: ~200 simultaneous objects
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with Canvas API

## üé® Assets & Credits

### Visual Design
- **Art Style**: Minimalist geometric shapes with neon colors
- **Color Palette**: Space-themed blues, cyans, and contrasting enemy colors
- **Effects**: Procedural particle systems and dynamic lighting
